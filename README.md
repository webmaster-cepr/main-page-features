INSTALLATION

Zip all files except the js folder and install via Joomla's Extension Manager. Javascript can either be placed in your template's head tags or in an external .js file. 

Requirements
* This module was tested with jQuery 1.10.2, so I cannot speak for older versions. Should be referenced in your template's head tags.
* This module was tested with Joomla 2.5.14.
